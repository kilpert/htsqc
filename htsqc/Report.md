<!--
This document was created by the htsqc pipeline. It contains several benchmark values on a specific squencing project at MPI-IE. The plots are intended to help evaluating the quality on a subsample of the overall reads.
The FASTQ files from a project were mapped with the HISAT aligner to available reference genomes. The benchmark values were aquired by using samtools view on the resulting BAM files.
